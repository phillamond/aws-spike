Feature: Email notification service
  As an end user
  In order to listen to new music by my favourite artists
  I need to be notified when they release a new track

  Scenario: User subscription to email notification service
    Given a running artist email notification ReST service
    When I make a PUT request to "/subscribe" with input body

      "artistId": "test:b12a908e7e224f6892fee6a8210b7d02"
